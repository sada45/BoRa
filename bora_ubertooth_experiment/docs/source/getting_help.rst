Asking Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have questions about using Ubertooth the first place to look is the `FAQ <https://ubertooth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`__.

Many Ubertooth developers and users are available in the `#ubertooth channel on Discord <https://discord.gg/rsfMw3rsU8>`__. Please remember that we work across many timezones and you may need to wait some time for a response to your question.



Software Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use the GitHub issue tracker to log Ubertooth bugs. If the bug has previously been reported then adding detail is often helpful. If you believe that you have found a new bug, then please create a new issue and describe the bug in as much detail as possible.

When logging issues it is helpful for us to know the following:

    * Software version
    * Firmware version
    * Operating system and hardware (i.e. ARM, x86, etc) if known
    * Which command you were using
    * Expected output
    * Actual output
    * Any other details that may help us to reproduce the bug
