# SX1280 Transmit native LoRa signals
========
This is an example to use a **NUCLEO-L073RZ** and a **SX1280RF1ZHP** shield board to periodically transmit native LoRa. 
To use this application, just make and flash it into the board and the SX1280 will start periodically transmit native LoRa packets once boot up.
```shell
cd tests/drivers/sx1280
make flash term
```
